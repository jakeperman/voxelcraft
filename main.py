'''
Minecraft clone using Ursina Game-Engine for Python (3.9).
Project status: Open-source
Original version: https://github.com/pokepetter/ursina/blob/master/samples/minecraft_clone.py
Contributor/s:
'''


'''
GOAL:

Add as many features to match the original game as possible until January 1st, 2022


PROBLEMS:

1. If too many blocks are added, the game slows down very noticeably.
2. There are a lot of gaps between textures which is caused by poorly drawn textures,
can be improved by redrawing them.


TO-DO:

1. Lower inventory (items) - DOING
2. Hotbar
3. Crouch
4. Improve jumping
5. Redraw textures
6. Improve void
7. Fly
8. Improve hand animations
9. Sprint
10. Maximum block removing reach: 4 blocks
11. Keep breaking/adding blocks after first one
12. Terrain generation
13. Crafting system
14. Upper inventory (armor, crafting, etc)
